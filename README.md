# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction

This project is a part of the course **CVE Final year project** at University Of Ilorin. The project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using various features like cement, water, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, etc. The dataset used for this project is available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength).


## Installation steps

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

     ```
